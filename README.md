# The_Grid
Malware finder and sorce code scanner.
For tranparancy I created this with the help of walktroughs in order to understand what I was coding. With this information I was able to create my own version of the Tron script.
(This program was heavily inspired by the Tron de-bloat program)

This program is set up into moduales that can be run independant from each other or as a unified entity, assuch this program is will only undertake defencvie actions for the User.

This program is still in its infantcy and more lessons will need to be learned before it reaches its full potential.
Expect further updates to this program.
